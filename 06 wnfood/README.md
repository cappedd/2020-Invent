# Project WnFood
This is a prototype for an app to help reduce food wastage in households.

## Functions
- Using the camera to scan the barcode on food products.
- Extract data from existing databases. Tried using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA8vSOBhCkARIsAGdp6RSNDwllsUtwPean4_Q-TGgn1IwmXBQG91mAFpFdXBg2k0Kku43-zHgaAvEaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) but couldn't get it to work yet so the inventory right now is staged.
- Add food products to an inventory.
